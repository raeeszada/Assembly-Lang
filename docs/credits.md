Easy-MASM would not have been possible without the direct/indirect help from the following:

* ASMDude's guide to [installing](https://asmdude.wordpress.com/2019/02/15/how-to-install-masm32-on-windows-10/) and [running](https://asmdude.wordpress.com/2019/02/14/how-to-compile-and-link-masm-on-windows-10/) MASM files
* [masm32-wine](https://github.com/olivatooo/masm32-wine) for inspiration and some source files
* GitHub user [bachittle](https://github.com/bachittle) for figuring out how to run this on Wine
* GitHub user [WahidBawa](https://github.com/WahidBawa) for providing me with some of these resources
* GitHub user [farooqiusman](https://github.com/farooqiusman) for helping me with common Wine issues
* GitHub user [kilbouri](https://github.com/kilbouri) for creating [Irvine32-Plus-Plus](https://github.com/kilbouri/Irvine32-Plus-Plus), a patched version of [Irvine's MASM library](http://www.asmirvine.com/) that allows for output and input redirection
* Anyone else who Stars, Forks, or contributes to this in the future :)
